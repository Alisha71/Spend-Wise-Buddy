# Spend-Wise-Buddy ðŸ’¸

**Spend-Wise-Buddy** is a command-line personal finance app built with Python and SQLite. It empowers users to track income and expenses, manage budgets, set savings goals, and analyse spending trends â€” all from a simple, interactive CLI.
It allows you to:

- Track income and daily expenses
- Manage budgets by category
- Set and monitor savings goals
- Analyze monthly/annual spending trends
- All through an interactive, easy-to-use CLI interface

This project was built as part of my transition into software engineering, applying core Python principles, modular design, and database integration to solve a real-world problem.
